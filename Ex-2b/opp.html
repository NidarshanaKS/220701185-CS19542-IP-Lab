      <h2>OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
      <p>
        Computer science and engineering graduates are the pillars of the
        current and emerging information era. Opportunities include pursuing
        Master of Science Programs in reputed Universities of U.S and Europe.
        and taking up research assignments in Hardware, System Software,
        Computer Engineering, Multimedia, Networking and Communication areas.
        Computer science is a broad field with many different job paths to
        choose from. With so many options, it can be difficult to decide on a
        certain route to study and focus on. Even if mastering only one specific
        subject of interest in Computer Science is possible, it is necessary to
        acquire all of the fundamentals connected to other areas in order to
        implement and use that subject of interest. For example, when writing
        Server-side scripts, we must know how to obtain data from databases
        and/or perform HTTP requests to retrieve information/outputs from APIs,
        in addition to dealing with the Frontend elements and delivering
        accordingly.

        So, in order to use databases and retrieve data via APIs, we must first
        understand the fundamental ideas and applications. Job opportunities are
        ever increasing and are varied in nature. System study, analysis, Design
        and Programming are the inherent phases in Application Development and
        each one of them provides enormous potential to the Computer Science and
        engineering graduates to shape their careers. Hi-end profiles include
        Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics,
        Graphic Solutions and Simulations, Mobile Application Development,
        Automation etc., The doors of companies are always open for Software
        Developer, Full Stack Software Developer, Data Analyst ,Data Scientist,
        Database Administrator, Cyber Security Specialist, Data Engineer,
        Machine Learning Engineer etc., with a huge package.
